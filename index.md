I am currently a data scientist for the [New York State Office of the Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I was a researcher at the [Johns Hopkins School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/health-behavior-and-society/research-and-practice){:target="_blank"} focusing on the social epidemiology of drug use.
